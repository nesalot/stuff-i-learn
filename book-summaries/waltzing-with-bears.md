# Waltzing with Bears

* **If a project has no risks, don't do it.** "They are almost always devoid of benefit; that's why they weren't done years ago."
* But you will need to know how to manage that risk.
* "A risk is a problem that has yet to occur, and a problem is a risk that has already materialized."
* Taking risk making sure a risk does not turn into a problem. This is called **Mitigation**.
* Mitigation is doing the homework; to prevent a fire, you place fire extinguishers around places. You might want constant monitoring of a fire (fire alarm). You might analyse that a room is not worth protecting at all.
