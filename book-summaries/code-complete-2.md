# Chapter 3: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Upstream Prerequisites

If your project were your building, then prereqs are things like obtaining the permits before building anything.

Data from the 1970s suggest that projects with prereqs prepared turn out to be more successful projects. Tight deadlines make requirements less relevant today, but is still very important.
