* Acquisition is one of the things most CEOs delay until it is too late.
* Your options (if any) is worth nothing until exercised, making them tax-free.
* Your options cannot be sold back to the company. That is, unless someone else wants to buy your options, they are also worth nothing.
* Your options are immediately vested ('yours', or eqv.) at no cost if the company gets acquired.
* Your options is exerciseable up to 90 days after you leaving the company.
* Avoid stocks you find on the news (for they become unstable), "the next big thing" companies, and companies that diversify through acquisition instead of innovation.
* [The four stages of company development](http://takeaswig.com/the-end-of-the-facebook-era): Emergence (when it started), Coalescence (when it becomes large enough that people can't ignore it), Bureaucratization (when it becomes a formal giant), and Decline (when it stops being useful)
* **Speculating**: buying a company's stocks when the company isn't making a profit.

# [Looking for a suitable investment class](http://www.iol.co.za/business/personal-finance/financial-planning/investments/investing-101-how-to-beat-inflation-1.1674984)

## Cash

Low volatility, no [risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/32kd0x/whether_youre_new_to_trading_or_notlean_on_these/.compact). Never beats inflation.

## Bonds

Issued by the government, bonds have low volatility, low risk, and low return (but beats inflation).
Bonds values do not correlate to stock market performance, so when the stock market is doing poorly, pick bonds.

## Property

Properties (e.g. houses that you don't live in) always beats inflation in the long term.
However, property are vulnerable to pricing bubbles.
Property value is linked to to bonds value.

## Equity ("stocks")

At the cost of high volatility, equity provides the highest return, provided that you pick the right stocks and get the timing right.

* Sell if stocks aren't appreciating (rising in value). They do nothing even if you hold on to them for a long time.
* Never spend all your money on stocks.
* Invest in a stock only if you have a good answer for "why are you investing in this particular stock?"

### Shorting

["Shorting" stocks](http://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/shorting-stocks.html) involves you borrowing your broker's stocks, buying your copy of these stocks at a lower price, and giving back these stocks to your broker. You end up with these stocks, and the price difference.

Similarly, [Margins](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/11/dangerous-moves-first-time-investors.asp?no_header_alt=true) involve borrowing money to buy stocks that (you hope it will) go up.

> Take this example â€“ you have $100 and borrow $50 to buy $150 of a stock. If the stock rises 10% ($165), you make $15, or a 15% return on your capital. But, if the stock declines 10% ($135), you lose $15, or a 15% loss. More importantly, if the stock goes up by 50% ($225), you make 75% return. But, if the stock declines 50% ($75), you lose all your money!

### Looking for a suitable company

* Read the company's *annual report*, *Standard & Poor's Stock Report* (See S&P500), and WSJ.
* *Earnings*, *earnings growth*, and *return on equity (ROE)* should be 10% higher than the year before.
* *Sales* and *Equity* (if present) should be higher than the year before.
* *Debt* should be less than half of the company's *assets*.
* The stock's *price-to-earnings ratio* should be between 20 and 40. [Generally speaking, having a high P/E ratio means that investors like you and believe that you have a bright future](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/05/the-new-fast-food/), but [too high of a P/E ratio means that the stock is overvalued.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/092200.asp)
* The stock's *price-to-sales ratio* should be close to 1.

[You should also like what the company does](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5rsnr5/what_is_the_most_important_research_before_buying/dd9v416/):
* Sales growth of at least 10% over the past year.
* Low debt
* High quality management with a good track record and unquestionable integrity
* Leading market position or a dominant player in a niche market
* Positive operating cash flow
* High insider ownership
* Competitive advantage of some sort, something that prevents or makes it hard for competition to enter

### Looking for a generic trade

* "Don't pick stocks" - [wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/5rules) (low MER index funds are good enough for most people)
* Buy gold when the market is stable. Since gold has inherent value, gold is often bought by others when the market is unstable, which is the time you should sell.
* Buy bonds when stocks are falling. (More research required)

### Looking for a suitable time

Further reading: [0001.md](sources/0001.md)

* [Buy the rumour sell the news](http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/2010/buy-on-the-rumor-sell-on-the-news-vod-vz-t-aapl-goog0706.aspx): traders typically dump shares immediately after a new product is introduced. You should therefore buy the shares somewhere around two weeks after the release, and sell a week before the hype cycle comes to a close.

#### To buy

* Consider buying stocks in a *bull market*: a market where people are starting to gain confidence in investing.
* Never buy stocks in a *bear market*: a market whose general prices are falling, and people are being pessimistic.
* *Johnson says that if you miss the top 10 days of equity market growth in a year you miss 90 percent of returns.*
* [When VIX is low its time to go; When VIX is high its time to buy](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/3dqggo/when_vix_is_low_its_time_to_go_when_vix_is_high)
* [Relative Strength Index, RSI](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) should be under 50. 100 means the stock is extremely overbought. 0 means the stock is extremely [oversold](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oversold.asp). See [stockcharts.com](http://stockcharts.com/freecharts/) for visuals. Be careful with the index, as modifying its calculation period can switch the results completely. "Oversold" may also just mean the stock is doing very poorly, instead of a bargain indicator.
* [Stochastic Oscillator](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:stochastic_oscillator_fast_slow_and_full) is like RSI, except it comes in three versions: %K (fast), %D (3-day moving average), and full (X-day moving average).
* "The best way to use RSI is to watch and wait for it to enter a zone and then for the %K to cross the %D in the opposite direction. That tends to be a signal that the stock is going to reverse its trend and is a great time to buy or sell."
* The stock's [beta](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) should be less than 1 (i.e. less volatile than the market). a Beta of 0.6 means the thing is 40% less volatile than the market. "Many utilities stocks have a beta of less than 1." "Negative betas are possible for investments that tend to go down when the market goes up."
* "Buy low sell high" is great, but [do not let world events affect your investing decisions](http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/03/warren-buffetts-5-key-investing-donts.html). During e.g. a war, stocks continue to go up. It is more worthwhile to hold onto securities (assets) than cash.
* In August. "October is known for bringing the highest shifts in volatility for a couple of reasons: third-quarter earnings season kicks off early October, and trading volume is significantly higher after the calm summer months." [Coca-cola](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO/) is almost cyclical in that you would have never lost money if you buy in August and sell in January.
* A "buy" [limit order](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) can be used to trigger a buy when a stock dips below a certain price.

#### [To sell](http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0412/5-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stock.aspx)

* When the price is right (hits your target). [Do not be greedy.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/learn-loss.asp)
* When the company is no longer doing its business the right way or making enough sales
* When a better stock exists
* When the company is acquired
* When the company goes bankrupt (selling it doesn't give you money, but you can claim it as capital loss)
* [When you anticipate a market failure](http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/53znlq/_/).
* When 10 years is up. That is enough time to guarantee a typical stock to have gone up.
* A "sell" [limit order](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) can be used to trigger a sell when a stock goes above a certain price.
* When it is November/December, and the price [went down during the year](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7b4x2z/end_of_year_selloff/). This can be claimed as investment loss. (Similarly, because you konw people will sell for tax credits, it is not wise to buy stocks in November/December, since they are likely to go down as people sell.)

### [Gap ups and downs](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:gap_trading_strategies#full_gap_upshort)

* A Full Gap Up occurs when the opening price is greater than yesterday's high price.
* A Full Gap Down occurs when the opening price is less than yesterday's low.
* A Partial Gap Up occurs when today's opening price is higher than yesterday's close, but not higher than yesterday's high.
* A Partial Gap Down occurs when the opening price is below yesterday's close, but not below yesterday's low.

## Mutual Funds

## ETFs (Exchange-traded funds)
[Leveraged ETFs are known for their natural decay. On the long term, holding a position in an N-times leveraged ETF is generally worse than holding an N-times leveraged position in the underlying asset.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/1864191-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-decay-of-leveraged-etfs) As /u/MasterCookSwag tried to put it simply: "You have $100 invested in dogshit and another $100 in 3x dogshit. Dogshit goes from $100 to $90 back to $100. Thats a loss of 10% then a subsequent gain of 11.11% for a net 0% move. 3x dogshit does, you guessed it, 3x that which means it loses 30% and subsequently gains 33.33%. That's a drop from $100 to $70 then back up to $93. You just lost 7% because of leverage. Voila. You lost money because of resetting leverage."

## [Management](https://medium.com/@gerstenzang/21-management-things-i-learned-at-imgur-7abb72bdf8bf)

* Don't attempt to manage unmotivated people.
* Give feedback frequently and directly.
* Fire quickly.
* Listen when people explain the reasoning behind their decisions.
* Define success clearly, so people can meet it.
* "Sometimes people talk shit. Sometimes people have bad days. Don't take either personally."

## [How not to fail](http://themacro.com/articles/2016/06/how-not-to-fail/)

* Make something people want. (be open to changing direction)
* Stay focused. (including networking)
* Measure your growth. (pick 'revenue' as a metric and focus on that)
* Know if youâ€™re default alive. (default alive is operational breakeven)
* Keep expenses low. (don't hire too many people)
* Fundraising gets harder. (VCs don't fund failures)

# Terms

* AUR: average user retention
* Board Lot: a unit for "number of shares" in your stock exchange. Typically, A lot is 100 shares. Because trading 100 shares is easier than trading 17 shares, trading is often done in lots.
* Book value: the "net asset value" of the company. A company's stock can (intrinsically) cost $5, but be traded at $300 because people love to speculate.
* Buy on Stop: buy, when the price hits the value you specified.
* Div yield (%): total dividend per year per share
* EPS: earnings per share
* MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence): The MACD is calculated by simply subtracting a 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) of the closing prices from a 12-period EMA. The signal line is a nine-period exponential moving average of the MACD.
* ROI (Return on investment): (Income - taxes) last year, divided by the debts. Higher is better.
* S&P500 (Standard & Poor's 500): stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ"
* [Underwriters](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp): they determine the offering price of a stock (whether initial aka IPO or when the company is bought out), and then get some underwriting fee for doing it. That price determined affect how the rest of the market prices the remaining stock. Say if you trade at $8 but the [bought deal](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boughtdeal.asp) offers each share at $7, then the market might adjust to $7.
* p.s. "bought deal" means someone buys all available shares.
* [Slippage](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is actually executed. However, [beta slippage](https://seekingalpha.com/article/1864191-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-decay-of-leveraged-etfs) is something else; it refers to the difference between "going down 10% and then back up by 10%", which, unfortunately, does not add up to 1.
