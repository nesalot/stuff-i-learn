1. `xcode-select --print-path` gives you where Xcode is installed.
1. `xcodebuild -list -project ???.xcodeproj` tells you what the Xcode project is configured to build, and information like targets and schemes.
1. Adding `build` after that command, i.e. `xcodebuild -project ???.xcodeproj build`, builds the `.app`.
1. "Archive" means "Compile", and "Compile" means something else, and "Build" means neither of the three.
1. iOS app submission requires one screenshot for each screen size your app claims to support.
