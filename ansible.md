# Setup

* First run `[sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html) && sudo apt-get update`. The version available to you will then be up to date.

# Configuration

* The [inventory file](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_getting_started.html#your-first-commands), `/etc/ansible/hosts`, list the remote servers you can SSH into.
* For remote machines that don'e support SFTP, [`scp-if-ssh`](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_configuration.html#scp-if-ssh) needs to be True.

# Uses

* Even without installing anything or using any playbooks, `ansible webservers -m ping` will ping all of your servers under your webserver section of your inventory file. That's because ansible comes with some number of utilities, `ping` included. See the full list with `ls -laR /usr/share/ansible/`.
