It was going pretty well, so I brought her back to my place. When I got there, my roommate bolted up from the couch and said he had to talk to me urgently. He said the girl had to leave. So I told her bye and she left. He reached down and scratched his asshole. Then he brought his finger up, and there were little bits of white on it. They looked like tiny pieces of rice. I said what the fuck is that. He said he didn't know. We forgot about it, but a month later it happened again. Then a month later, again. His asshole would get all itchy, then it would get covered with little white rices. Eventually we started calling this his ass period, because it came once a month and made him grouchy. The only other side effect was that he developed disgusting gas and burps that we called "vomit burps" because they smelled like vomit. if he vomit burped, it could stink up an entire car like vomit and make everyone else want to barf. Well, he was pre med, so he started researching it. One day he went to the clinic, and he came back really grouchy. He had a pill that he called "the horse pill." He said that it was a nuke and it would destroy his problem. We didn't ask what the problem was, but a few days later he got an awful stomach ache and went for a shit. He said he felt something dying inside of him, wiggling around and fighting. Basically he went to shit, and he pooped out the mother. The mother would "segment" once a month and send out the little rices, which were its babies. That's what we found out. So the mother came out of his butthole, but only part way. He had to grab it and pull it out of his ass bit by bit. Hand over hand, like a sailor pulling a rope. It was very long, he said. When he came out of the bathroom he was white as a sheet, and all he said was "it's over" and **"never tell anyone about this."**' [/u/So_Many_Owls](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7ddi2k/north_korean_defector_had_10inch_parasite_in_his/dpxirbz/): "He asked you to do one thing."

1. You can calculate how much you need to invest into your retirement by reverse calculating from how much you want every month (no taxes for simplicity). Say you want $10k in passive income every month in whichever currency. A year of that is $120k, and if you say you get that much from a 5% capital growth per year, then your actual investment is 120k / 5% = 2.4M. So you will have to figure out how to get this 2.4M in 20 years. 2.4M in 20 years is (interestingly enough) back to 120k per year. So unless you save 10k every month now, you aren't retiring.

They have run into those same problems before and have a very good idea of where to look first. Seniors often mentor outside the workplace as well. They generally have at least ten years of experience and have almost always been on at least one death march and know exactly why some things are to be avoided. They know how to deliver a working product and meet a deadline. They know what corners can be cut and what corners should never be cut. They know at least one and often several languages at the expert level. They have seen a lot of "hot new technologies" hit the workplace and disappear, so they tend to be a bit more conservative about jumping on the bandwagon for the next exciting new development tool (but not completely resistant to change - those would be the older Intermediate developers who never make the leap to Senior). They understand their job is to deliver working software that does what the users want, not to play with fun tools. They are often pickier about where they will work because they can be and because they have seen first hand how bad some places can be. They seek out the places that have the most interesting tasks to do. Often they know more about their company's products than anyone else even if they have been there only a few months. They know they need more than programming knowledge and are good at getting knowledge about the business domain they support as well. They are often aware of issues that juniors never consider and intermediates often don't think about such as regulatory and legal issues in the business domain they support. They can and will push back a requirement because they know what the problems with it will be and can explain the same to the laymen." - HLGEM](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/14972/116811)

Or maybe you've been driving a couple hours and you've already seen two deer and a moose and you know if you don't stay alert you're going to hit one and die. So you go grab a Timmies and stretch you legs. We know the coffee isn't to die for, and the donuts are just do hints but it's a comfort to us. Tim Hortons is always going to be just around the corner, it's always going to have that warm welcoming smell and you're never going to kick off a road trip with out it.

1. The reason you wake up at the middle of the night after heavy drinking: alcohol does not turn into any kind of sugar. In fact, alcohol tends to induce a hypoglycemic state, which is hypothesized to be one of the reasons that drinking on an empty stomach tends to make you more inebriated--a lot of the signs of low blood sugar mimic alcohol intoxication. This is because when alcohol is metabolized, it passes off some of its chemical energy to a compound called NAD, reducing it to NADH, which the cell uses for metabolic purposes. However, when alcohol floods the liver with NADH, the relative amount of NAD available is fairly low, and this molecule is required for several of the reactions of gluconeogenesis, which is the process by which the liver creates glucose in between meals. Hence, alcohol on an empty stomach can cause low blood glucose by inhibiting the livers ability to perform gluconeogenesis. It also never acts as a "stimulant" in any way. It is eventually metabolized to acetic acid, which is not a stimulant.
