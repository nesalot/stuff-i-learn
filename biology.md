1. (Soluble) fibres lower cholesterol via Le Chatelier's Principle: *When fiber interferes with absorption of bile in the intestines, the bile is excreted in the feces. To make up for this loss of bile, the liver makes more bile salts. The body uses cholesterol to make bile salts. So in order to obtain the cholesterol necessary to make more bile salts, the liver increases its production of LDL receptors. These receptors are responsible for pulling cholesterol out of LDL molecules in the bloodstream. Therefore, the more bile salts are made from the liver, the more LDL cholesterol is pulled from the blood.*

1. [Cymothoa exigua, or the tongue-eating louse, is a parasitic isopod of the family Cymothoidae. This parasite enters fish through the gills, and then attaches itself to the fish's tongue. The female attaches to the tongue and the male attaches on the gill arches beneath and behind the female. Females are 8–29 millimetres (0.3–1.1 in) long and 4–14 mm (0.16–0.55 in) in maximum width. Males are approximately 7.5–15 mm (0.3–0.6 in) long and 3–7 mm (0.12–0.28 in) wide. The parasite severs the blood vessels in the fish's tongue, causing the tongue to fall off. It then attaches itself to the stub of what was once its tongue and becomes the fish's new tongue.](https://imgur.com/gallery/3uW8U)
1. After mating, the male Parnassines (Swallowtail butterfly) produce a glue like substance that is used to seal the female genital opening and prevent other males from mating.
1. After the caterpillar becomes a butterfly, the toxin shift to different parts of the body. Since many birds attack the wings of the butterfly, having three times the cardiac glycosides in the wings leaves predators with a very foul taste and may prevent them from ever ingesting the body of the butterfly. **WITH THAT SAID** In order to combat predators that remove the wings only to ingest the abdomen, [monarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly) keep the most potent cardiac glycosides in their abdomens.

1. Fish don't freeze in salt water, despite being less salty than salt water, because animal glycoproteins inhibit ice crystal growth. [Exact mechanism is explained here](https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/why-dont-fish-freeze-to-death-in-icy-water/): "flat crystal faces with high growth rates were truncated by faces with slower growth rates, causing the polyhedral crystal to be surrounded by only flat faces with the lowest growth rates. This resulted in greatly slowing down the growth of the ice crystals."
